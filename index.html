        <p>Have you ever looked at your server or website logs and realized that they make absolutely no sense to you? Or thought that logs just seem to take up a lot of valuable server space? Perhaps they failed to provide clear insights into what happened in the first place?

        As a security company, we deal with a lot of compromised websites on a daily basis. Unfortunately, we often have limited access to customer logs, which is one of the reasons why we don’t offer forensic analysis.
        
        Website infections can be caused by something as simple as a compromised admin user — and resetting the password for all admin users would be a simple fix for this issue. However, most of the infected websites we clean have no logs to tell us exactly what happened that led to the website compromise, which can make it difficult to know exactly how the website was infected in the first place.</p>
